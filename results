- Missing values are present in several columns such as Gender, Married, Dependents, Self_Employed, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, and Credit_History .
- These missing values are filled using the mode for categorical variables and the mean for numerical variables .
Credit History:

Applicants with a higher credit history (value of 1) are more likely to be eligible for a loan. This is evident from the crosstab showing that a majority of applicants with a credit history of 1 are approved for loans .
Outliers:

Outliers are present in the ApplicantIncome and LoanAmount columns. Boxplots reveal significant outliers, especially in ApplicantIncome .
Skewed Data and Normalization:

The ApplicantIncome and CoapplicantIncome histograms are highly skewed, necessitating normalization. The log transformation is applied to LoanAmount to reduce skewness, making the data more normally distributed .
Categorical to Numerical Conversion:

Categorical variables such as Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, Property_Area, and Loan_Status are converted to numerical values for model training. This is achieved using techniques like label encoding or one-hot encoding .
Data Division:

The data is divided into independent (features) and dependent (target) variables. The independent variables include attributes like Gender, Married, Dependents, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, and Total_Income, while the dependent variable is Loan_Status .
